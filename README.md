# Descentralized Electoral Voting

This dApp was made to interact with an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity called Electoral Voting.
You are able to deploy a new contract or interact with an existing one (you only need it's address).


## Installation

You'll need to install an extension like Metamask in order to interact properly with the contract.


## Usage

Open [this link](https://brunopedrazza.github.io/descentralized-electoral-voting/) hosted on Github pages. Everything runs out of the box.
You need to accept a connection between the extension and the application.


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
